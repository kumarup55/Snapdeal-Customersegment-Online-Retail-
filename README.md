# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm to identify distinct customer groups based on their behavior and characteristics. The goal is to demonstrate how unsupervised machine learning techniques can be applied in a real-world business context to support data-driven decision-making and targeted marketing strategies.

This project was completed as part of a certified mentorship program and reflects both technical accuracy and business-oriented analysis.

## Business Problem
Businesses often struggle to understand diverse customer behaviors using raw data alone. This project addresses that challenge by grouping customers into meaningful segments, enabling organizations to:
- Personalize marketing campaigns
- Improve customer engagement
- Identify high-value customer groups
- Optimize business strategies

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-related features used for segmentation. The data was cleaned, preprocessed, and scaled to ensure accurate distance-based clustering.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Implementation of K-Means clustering
- Use of the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Model training and cluster assignment
- Visualization of clusters and customer profiles

---

## Key Insights
- K-Means clustering was implemented using proper preprocessing and logical steps, including feature scaling and optimal cluster selection.
- Visualizations such as cluster plots and customer profiles clearly highlight differences between customer segments.
- The identified clusters provide actionable insights that can be used for **targeted marketing and customer segmentation**.
- The project demonstrates how clustering techniques can directly support business growth and strategic decision-making.

---

## Results & Conclusion
The analysis successfully groups customers into meaningful segments, making it easier for businesses to understand customer behavior and design focused marketing strategies. This project highlights the practical value of machine learning in solving real-world business problems.


## Future Enhancements
- Adding predictive models for customer behavior
- Integrating advanced clustering techniques
- Building interactive dashboards for business users
